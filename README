Try:

./selection [<clipboard>]

To copy the image to the <clipboard> in the form of a PNG, JPEG, TIFF,
BMP URL string or text string. If you do not specify <clipboard>
PRIMARY will be used.

./selection -dnd

To do the largely same, except with a window to drag the image from rather
than holding it in the clipboard.



Then

./paste [<clipboard> [type1 [type2 [ ... ] ] ] ]

Paste the data in <clipboard> or PRIMARY (select/middle click). You must
specify <clipboard> if you want to specify which datatypes to fetch in
order of preference. STRING is used if none are specified.


./paste -dnd [...]

to do the same, except it provides a window to drop things on to, instead of
pasting from PRIMARY.



Operation of these programs is very verbose, and well documented in paste.cc
