Try:

./selection [clipboard]

To copy the image to the clipboard in the form of a PNG, JPEG, TIFF, BMP
URL string or text string. Optionally specify clipboard to use instead of
PRIMARY.

./selection -dnd

To do the largely same, except with a window to drag the image from rather
than holding it in the clipboard.



Then

./paste [type1 [type2 [ ... ] ] ]

Paste the data in PRIMARY (select/middle click) clipboard. Optionally specify
which datatypes to fetch in order of preference. STRING is used if none are
specified.


./paste -dnd [...]

to do the same, except it provides a window to drop things on to, instead of
pasting from PRIMARY.



Operation of these programs is very verbose, and well documented in paste.cc
